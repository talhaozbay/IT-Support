## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/talhaozbay/IT-Support.git
   cd IT-Support/IT-Support
   ```

2. **Development environment**:  
   - The project targets **.NET 8.0**.  
   - It can be built using Visual Studio 2022/2025 or the `dotnet CLI`.  

3. **Open the solution**:  
   - Open `IT-Support.sln` in Visual Studio, or  
   - Run `dotnet build` from the command line.  

4. **Prepare SMTP credentials**:  
   - The `App.config` file contains **keyd** and **keym** settings.  
   - These must be replaced with your encrypted email address and password.  

   Example encryption:  

   ```csharp
   using IT_Support;

   string email = "support@yourcompany.com";
   string password = "YourPassword123";

   string encryptedEmail = AesCrypto.EncryptString(email);
   string encryptedPassword = AesCrypto.EncryptString(password);

   Console.WriteLine($"keyd: {encryptedEmail}\nkeym: {encryptedPassword}");
   ```

   - Place the generated `keyd` and `keym` values in the `<appSettings>` section of **App.config**.  

5. **SMTP server settings**:  
   - By default, the app uses `smtp.office365.com` (port 587).  
   - If you need another server, update the `SendMail` method in **MainWindow.xaml.cs**.
